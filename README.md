# diaryWeb
The diary web(To-do, D-day, Memo, Calender)
Difference from the existing proposal
- Deleting Memo temporarily
- Store and option features on hold (only icons are created)
- Reduce the functionality of the calendar (previously it was a calendar + simple memo, but only the functionality of the calendar is possible)
